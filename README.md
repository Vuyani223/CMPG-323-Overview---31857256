Project and repository context
- Each project will have its own repository

Branching Strategies
- I plan to create atleast 1 branch apart from the main branch within each repository to work on the specific project requirements and later push and commit my work to the main branch.

Use of the .gitignore file
-

Storage of credentials and sensitive information 
- I plan to store all credentials and sensitive information in a ---- file. I'll add this file to the .gitignore. This will prevent the file to be published on github leaving this confidential information undisclosed to the public.
