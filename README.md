Project and repository context
- Each project will have its own repository and all the repositories of each project will be linked to the Kanban wall in the "Overview" repository
- By swiftly scanning through the projects and their requirements I've come up with the following table regarding project and repository context. This is subject to change.
	
Branching Strategies
- I plan to create atleast 1 branch apart from the main branch within each repository to work on the specific project requirements and later push and commit my work to the main branch.

Use of the .gitignore file
-

Storage of credentials and sensitive information 
- I plan to store all credentials and sensitive information in a ---- file. I'll add this file to the .gitignore. This will prevent the file to be published on github leaving this confidential information undisclosed to the public.
