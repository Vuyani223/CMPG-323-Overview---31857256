<h1>Project 1</h1>

<h2> Repositories to be created </h2>

</ul>

<h2>Project and repository context</h2>
- Each project will have its own repository and all the repositories of each project will be linked to the Kanban wall in the "Overview" repository
- By swiftly scanning through the projects and their requirements I've come up with the following table regarding project and repository context. This is subject to change.
<table>
	<tr>
		<th> </th>
		<th>Project 1</th>
		<th>Project 2</th>
		<th>Project 3</th>
		<th>Project 4</th>
		<th>Project 5</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Create and configure new repository?</td>
		<td>Yes</td>
		<td>Yes</td>
		<td>Yes</td>
		<td>Yes</td>
		<td>Yes</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Create a new project?</td>
		<td>Yes</td>
		<td> </td>
		<td>"Fork existing project"</td>
		<td>"Clone existing repository"</td>
		<td>"Clone existing repository"</td>
		
	</tr>
</table>
	
<h2>Branching Strategies</h2>
- I plan to create atleast 1 branch apart from the main branch within each repository to work on the specific project requirements and later push and commit my work to the main branch.

<h2>Use of the .gitignore file</h2>
- All the files I don't want to publish on GitHub will be added into the .gitignore file.

<h2>Storage of credentials and sensitive information</h2> 
- I plan to store all credentials and sensitive information in a ---- file. I'll add this file to the .gitignore. This will prevent the file to be published on github leaving this confidential information undisclosed to the public.
